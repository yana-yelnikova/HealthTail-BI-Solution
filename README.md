## üìÑ Project Overview

This project is a comprehensive Business Intelligence solution for **HealthTail**, a large veterinary hospital. The goal is to automate their medication auditing process and analyze disease trends among patients.

The project transforms raw `.csv` data into an interactive **Looker Studio dashboard** by leveraging Google Cloud Platform (GCP) services. It demonstrates a complete end-to-end data workflow: from data ingestion and transformation in **BigQuery** to final visualization.
